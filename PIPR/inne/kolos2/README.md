# PIPR OOP showcases

Examples:

* `cheapcalc` - refactored version of `cheapcalc`'s command line interface from unit testing lab
* `lotto` - refactored version of `lotto` game from OOP part 2 lab
* `polynomial` - bonus material, an OOP implementation of a polynomial

Note how the examples use concepts like constants, docstrings, type hints, decomposition and custom exceptions.
